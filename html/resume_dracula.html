            <strong>Systems Programmer II</strong> •
            <em>North Pole, Department of Administration</em>
          </p>
          <p class="body-line">North Pole • October 2018 to Current</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Led transition from Proofpoint to Defender for O365, developing
              and maintaining comprehensive policies and procedures for threat
              response. Collaborated closely with Information Security Office
              (ISO) to refine and implement new policies, integrating services
              like KnowBe4 to enhance security awareness.
            </li>
            <li>
              Designed and tested enrollment profiles and compliance policies
              within Intune for SOA's new AT&T devices. Coordinated with various
              departments, stakeholders, and AT&T, automating enrollment of new
              phones and accounts. Worked on creating department-specific
              policies to address diverse operational scenarios.
            </li>
            <li>
              Managed assignment of M365 licensing SKUs and updated licensing
              script and corresponding JSON file to create tailored licensing
              loadouts. Assigned licenses to over 15,000 G5 users and adapted
              licensing structure for departmental changes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Leveraged Azure Entra ID to create dynamic user groups and admin
              units, delegating Authentication Administrator role to department
              IT staff. This strategy improved efficiency in MFA resets and
              reduced dependency on MAD or ISO.
            </li>
            <li>
              Edited and managed Conditional Access policies, enhancing security
              for department developers' applications with appropriate
              protocols.

            <li>
              Facilitated knowledge sharing with other state departments,
              leading to adoption of DOR's Windows 10 imaging task sequence by
              Department of Administration. This collaboration substantially
              reduced their time to deployment.
